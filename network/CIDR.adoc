= CIDR - Classless inter-domain Routing

== What is CIDR notation/pattern?

Classless Inter-Domain routing reduces the wastage of IP addresses by extra required number of IP address to the users. It represents the IP address along with special number (/n) to specify the number of bits present in the network ID.


	172.19.0.0/16

	1010 1100 001 111/ 0000 0000 0000  0000

	Network ID      /  Host ID

    8 + 8 + 8 + 8 => 32 bits

Eg:

192.169.0.1/24
    `192.169.0` is `network portion/id` and `1` is for `host ID`.

192.169.0.1/16
    `192.169` is `network portion/id` and `0.1` is for `host ID`


== CIDR - VPC [Practical]

1. Create CIDR with availablity od 256 IP address

    172.31.0.0/24
    Network portion -> 24 bit
    host portion    -> 8 bit

2. Break VPC into 2 subnet equally

    Subnet 1
    172.31.0.0/25
    Network portion -> 25 bit 
    host portion    -> 7 bit (0 to 127)

    Subnet 2
    172.31.0.128/25
    Network portion -> 25 bit
    host portion    -> 7 bit
